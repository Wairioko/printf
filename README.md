# printf
Printf is a project that emulates the functionalities of the function 'printf()' of the programming language CProject information rocket
Below, additional information that we had to take into account in order to develop the project, such as requirements and resources, will be presented. As well as the contact of the developers of this project.

Compilation computer
-Your code will be compiled this way:

$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c

Format Specifiers grey_exclamation
Function name	Description	Format Specifier
print_c	Prints a character	%c
print_s	Prints a string	%s
print_p	Prints a %	%%
print_i	Prints an integer	%d & %i
print_o	Prints number in base 8	%o
print_b	Prints a binary, custom specifier	%b
print_hexLower	Prints hexadecimal in lowercase	%x
print_hexUpper	Prints hexadecimal in uppercase	%X
print_u	Prints unsigned integer	%u
print_r	Prints string in reverse, custom specifier	%r
print_R	Prints string in rot13, custom specifier	%R
Requeriments pushpin
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
Note that we will not provide the _putchar function for this project
